First steps:
-create window - DONE
-Render runes - DONE
-implement click & release - DONE
-implement drag & drop - DONE
--get cursor position on click/release - DONE

-figure out how to place sprite in specific position - DONE
-figure out how to change window size - CANCELLED; Window size is 1280 x 720, which is fine
-figure out how to render multiple assets - DONE
+++
next step: Prototype
-build for WASM/web (check playability)
-implement one rune magic effect (move in zero gravity single direction)
-implement start of chain reaction (including test attempts / final attempt logic)
-implement one follow up effect based on placed rune (triggered by the end of the previous effect)
--figure out how to detect "collision"
-enable/disable player input before-and-after/during chain reaction
-figure out how to track when a machine has reached it's conclusion (both success and failure)

goal: enable player to set up a single chain reaction with at least two components and play on web, with a detected failure/success
