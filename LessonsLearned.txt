Logging:
The default logging Plugin, as part of the DefaultPlugin, uses a runtime filter
the default runtime filter uses log level INFO
The compile time filter does NOT override this
>> debug & trace logs did not show up even though the compile time filter was set to trace

solution:
-had to add "use bevy::log::*;" because LogPlugin was not part of prelude
-added the follwoing to App setup:
App::new()
+++
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins
        .set(LogPlugin {
            level: Level::TRACE,
            ..Default::default()
        }))
+++
>> now all debug & trace logs showed, including logs from the engine

new task: how to only log trace/debug from my game, not the engine
>> added a filter for everything that isn't my application to level error:
+++
.set(LogPlugin {
            filter: "error,bevy_jam_6=trace".to_string(),
            level: Level::TRACE,
            ..Default::default()
        }))

========================================================================
getting mouse position at time of button press made more suspense
-> cursor_evr: EventReader<CursorMoved>, removed

the example I found wasn't quite up to date
A "Result" was returned, wrapping an option
-> need to unwrap the result with .ok(), and then the Option with .unwrap()
>> not checking for errors here for brevity's sake; I'll just assume it works

========================================================================
Sprites and transforms

Sprites by default anchor at the center (says so in Sprite.rs of engine)
it requires a transform -> what does that mean again...?
-> intuitive way to use this would be to give an entity a transform and manipulate that
>> raises the question how exactly a sprite-offset from it's parent would look like, but not relevant in my case (maybe child entity with it's own transform?)

========================================================================
Queries

conflicting queries cause the app to panic
in my case, querying all Pickables and the Signle Picked entity in the same system caused a crash
solution: added "Without<Picked" to the Query that queries all Pickables:
pickables: Query<(&mut Transform, &Sprite), (With<Pickable>, Without<Picked>)>,
    picked: Single<&mut Transform, With<Picked>>,

note that the With<..> and Without<..> are part of a tuple, not a 3rd argument to the query (Query only accepts two arguments)

========================================================================

Sprite size

accessing the actual size of asprite is a bit tricky; it's necessary to get the image size through the Image-Assets-Ressource, and multiply it with the transform scale
this is only valid if custom_size isn't used

========================================================================

Game Freeze

after removing the 'Picked' Component from the only Sprite in the scene, the game froze
setup was still completed, but it didn't run the controls-system once; suggests to me it freezes because of the query
-> must be one of the two Queries for Pickables/Picked

approach: add second Pickable to the scene an see what happens; first one keep the 'Picked' component for now
result: game freezes without ever running control system -> suggests the Query for Pickables is the problem
WRONG: I added the 'Picked' component to the second rune by accident... but then why did the game freeze...?

approach: correctly this time: first Rune gets Picked-comp, second one doesn't
result: game runs as expected

approach: remove Picked-Comp from first rune
result: setup completes, scene is rendered, but controls system fails entirely
solution from description of Single-struct:

"This SystemParam fails validation if zero or more than one matching entity exists.
This will cause the system to be skipped, according to the rules laid out in SystemParamValidationError."
-> explains why this doesn't run at all with 0 or 2 Picked entities :D
>> need to use: Option<Single<...>>

Follow up question: how to actually use / unwrap/ access the Option<Single<..>>?
