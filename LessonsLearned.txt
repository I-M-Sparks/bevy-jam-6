Logging:
The default logging Plugin, as part of the DefaultPlugin, uses a runtime filter
the default runtime filter uses log level INFO
The compile time filter does NOT override this
>> debug & trace logs did not show up even though the compile time filter was set to trace

solution:
-had to add "use bevy::log::*;" because LogPlugin was not part of prelude
-added the follwoing to App setup:
App::new()
+++
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins
        .set(LogPlugin {
            level: Level::TRACE,
            ..Default::default()
        }))
+++
>> now all debug & trace logs showed, including logs from the engine

new task: how to only log trace/debug from my game, not the engine
>> added a filter for everything that isn't my application to level error:
+++
.set(LogPlugin {
            filter: "error,bevy_jam_6=trace".to_string(),
            level: Level::TRACE,
            ..Default::default()
        }))
+++

getting mouse position at time of button press made more suspense
