rube-goldberg-machine
    A Rube Goldberg machine, named after American cartoonist Rube Goldberg, is a chain reactionâ€“type machine or contraption intentionally designed to perform a simple task in a comically overcomplicated way. 

idea: plan a RGM, then take it apart and make the player put it back together?

take it literally: make a chain react to something? maybe it's elemental? like a chain of fireballs reaction to water?

idea: chain -> blockchain? have a blockchain react? kind of educational? serious game?

Chain reaction (1996): use movie story as gameplay basis? replay story?
    in short: fusion reaction is found, but private sector wants it, scientists are framed, need to run

questions:
Is the chain reaction wanted/intended/the goal? what the end result?
is the reaction identical (like bombs in a row, domnioes, things catching fire)?
is the chain an actual chain?
re-action -> what is the action/trigger?
is the trigger automatically, time based, event based, by the player?
is the chain reaction physical, like things falling over using 2D physics?
or more like automated system of e.g. robots running a code?
are consequences foreseeable or not? or is it more try and error?
-> consequences should only vaguely foreseeable, creating suspense
-> failure should be no frustrating
-> encourage experimentation (best done through aesthetics)
"mess around and find out"?

genre/style:
2D to make my life easy :)

kenney packs of interest:
letter-tiles: chain of words -> whats the reaction?
generic-items: excellent fit for RGM
top-down-shoot: for scenery?
top-down tower defense?
playing cards -> maybe get a random set of cards, dice rolls and build sopmething with it? -> Balatro style?
input prompt pixel 16x -> perform a series of actions quickly and correctly to keep a chain reaction going until it's end?
Rune pack -> every rune has an effect, which influences the following runes, player has to experiment to find the right "chain of events"?
-> like rune A summons beast, rune B makes it attack, rune C set it on fire...?
-> every rune = one event -> events build on top of each other...?
---> not really what a chain reaction is though... unless hearthsone style: set up a chain of reactions to each other...
-> maybe add location based effects....? like rune A shoots at rune B, rune C mingles etc.

Google eyes for funsies

thought:
the chain reaction might be "recursive" in a way?
iterate the chain reaction multiple times and every time it "increases" in effect some way?

limitations copied from kenney jam:
1. Single pack: Your game should only use a single asset pack -> no
2. No text: Create a game that doesn't use any text at all -> TBD
3. Mouse only: Your game should be fully controlled using only the mouse -> TBD
4. Co-op: Your game should feature co-op gameplay -> no
5. Symmetry: Your game should heavily feature symmetrical elements in visuals, mechanics or both-> TBD
6. Cross Dimensional: Use 2D sprites in a 3D world -> no

Idea run-through:
Rune Magic

Every rune has an effect and reacts to other runes effects (like triggered by fire, causes ice etc.)
note: 3 colors for each rune
total of runes: 35 (* 3 colors = 105) +  colors, Particle Pack effects, different backgrounds...
RGM with rune magic (kind of)?
idea: the magic channeled through each rune is amplified and modified by the rune, potentially escalating in the wrong direction...?
-> watching the chain reaction should be interesting, outcome should be only somewhat unpredictable

Important: outcome should not be obvious all the time, but player should be able to have an idea of how things will go
inspiration: hearthstone special game mode where player had only one move and had to fulfill a task by setting of the correct chain reaction

question:
does the player set ALL the runes or just one? or partial?

Idea: you could play two or more runes which trigger chain reactions that meet later on?

chat suggestion: tutorial where slots to play are added gradually?

note: difficulty is in the complexity

thought: (aesthetics) you are a support mage in a battle and need to help your allies with your rune magic
-> have something going on while chain of events is happening, creating the needed suspense
-> could also be that the user has to choose a rune while events are happening and user has to act on the spot?
(not easy with 35 options!)

RGM with Rune magic:
using runes to achieve an effect is totally unnecessarily complicated
-> idea: buffing an axe fighter is not just a fire rune, it's body+fire+water+something;
just using a fire rune sets them on fire
-> player has to come up with sequence of rune to achieve correct effect, otherwhise chaos happens

idea:
there are multiple options for the next step in the chain, and the player has to find the correct order of steps + the correct runes to use at each step?

player choices: steps to take, runes to use
-> wrong steps / runes have unwanted effect
-> kind of predictable, but not quite
-> comes down to: object + rune = maybe known effect
-> goal is to figure out which runes have which effect and what reaction they then trigger

MVP:
one RGM with runes
-> not every level has every rune
-> could also add conditional chains, like heated objects meeting an additional rune, or living things, etc
QUESTION:
is it one object undergoing a series of events?
one rune = one new effect? how to predict?
-> attach an effect to object
-> each object in the RGM is connected with a rune that activates when triggered, effect may be more or less predictable

project tile: "The Rune Goldberg Machine"
chat suggestion: Rune Generated Magic

Idea: player is given a combination of runes and items and must combine them to achieve a simple task; this should never be straightforward
-> requires some creative problem solving by the player
-> there might always be more than one way to solve a puzzle, which is fine

IDEA: the trigger & the effect might be separate; i.e. when black Rune A ist set on fire, white rune B start doing something; grey rune A is both trigger & effect source

=========================

-Game design questions:
--does the player know what the runes do / is it explained? if yes: how?
--> decision: no, player must figure out what the runes do by experimentation
--what exactly do the runes do?
-> good question :D
Thoughts:
--> move things around (left, right, up, down)
--> lock/unlock physics (like gravitation)
--> invert physics (shift gravitation)
--> 

--does the player trigger the chain, or does it trigger automatically? does it trigger once, or repeatedly? Does the player have unlimited attempts?
--> idea: the player triggers the chain by using a marble
--> player receives up to X "test marbles" to let the machine run and see if it works (let's say the grey one)
--> once they put in the 'blue marble', it's all or nothing
---> if they succeed without using all of their test marbles, they get bonus points?

Idea 1:
-machine runs every X seconds
-players needs to observe & adjust between runs
-player has only Y attempts to solve the machine aka achieve effect

Idea 2:
-physics puzzle (fake physics, unless people have put in the wrong rune -> let it go wild!)
-- makes actual 2D physics optional
-player can shift/activate/deactivate gravitation, create impulses on target object, teleport, open a portal... make it immune to destruction
--other effects are possible too
--> with 35 runes, plenty of effects possible
-to make it more interesting: have multiple moving parts at once, each triggering new effects
--> multiple chain reactions running in parallel

+++
Conclusion Game Design:
-Pseudo-physics puzzle (not actual physics)
-Player has to set up 1 or more chain reactions running in parallel
-they have X attempts to see how things work out
-they can choose to to the final attempt early for bonus points (as optional challenge)
-runes are placed to cause the "magic physics" (no gravitation, double gravitation, teleport, shifted gravitation, impulse to move...?, ...)

Challenge is: figure out the correct sequence of events with the given runes available

QUESTION: limited time? -> rather not, could be too punishing, espcially without the chance to balance the difficulty -> limited attempts is hard enough
+++
Visual Design:
Player needs to create a series of effects to make donuts

The goal donut is displayed

if the chain reaction goes wrong or happens at the wrong time, the wrong donut is made and the world ends.
for example: rotatin ring of sprinkles, and the sprinkeling must happen at the correct time, triggered by the chain reaction

Must have visual packs:
-Donuts
-Emote Pack

+++
Idea from the Board game pack: the trigger for a next event could be completing a series of cards
alternatively: complete a word
